# Smart-Egg-Candling-System

ABSTRACT
One of the significant factors in increasing the productivity of the incubation industry is monitoring the growth and development of eggs, as well as detecting abnormalities through candling. A technique that involves applying light to an egg to make it transparent enough for vision and analysis.
Manual egg candling is time-consuming and pays a toll on workersâ€™ wealth and health. It is mainly prevalent in small and medium businesses in developing countries.
The following study describes the development of a smart egg candling system. The system combines the use of a cheap Candling Unit for illuminating chicken eggs and an android Application for egg classification. Thus, classifying chicken eggs in three different stages; early, middle, and late-stage with the help of an incorporated trained TensorFlow Lite model.
Unlike other systems, this system operates offline and is easy to implement.
